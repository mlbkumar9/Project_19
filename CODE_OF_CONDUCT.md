# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces. This includes but is not limited to:

* Our community forums
* Our issue trackers
* Our chat rooms
* Our social media accounts

It also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the community leaders. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The community leaders are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
